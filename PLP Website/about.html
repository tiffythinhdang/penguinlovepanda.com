			About two years ago, we discovered Catana Comics and fell in love with her cute and quirky stories. We joked about how similar those stories were to our relationship and that we should make our own comics one day. Little did we know that I would actually do just that. At the end of June 2017, I drew the first draft of our characters’ design; and a few days later, the first story of <a class = "bold italics">Penguin Loves Panda</a> was born. Why penguin and panda? ‘Cause those are our favorite animals!
			<br>
			<br>
			Each story in <a class = "bold italics">Penguin Loves Panda</a> is a reminder of a moment that we have shared in our relationship. We giggle and laugh every time we look at them. Through these little stories of our daily encounters, we hope to bring <a class = "bold italics">“a snippet of joy”</a> to your life too!
			<br>
			<br>
			Love,
			<br>
			<br>
			Tiff and Andy
